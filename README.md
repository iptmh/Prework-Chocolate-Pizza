# Code 301 Pre-work: Intermediate Software Development

To get your laptop and yourself ready for the start of Code 301, there are a series of pre-work tasks to complete. 

Before completing the tasks in this document, ensure that you have completed all of the installation tasks in the [Code 201 Prework](https://github.com/codefellows/code-201-prework).

In particular, if you have tested in to Code 301 and did not take Code 201, be especially attentive to the git and GitHub portion of the Code 201 prework. Note that your future classmates who took 201 will already have a month of practice using git and GitHub; it is a common area of challenge in 301 for students who tested in to the course. 

Note that the tasks below have a corresponding assignment to submit in your Canvas course, but be aware that at the time you receive the link to this pre-work that the Canvas course may not yet be published, depending upon the timing of Admissions processes and when class begins. Typically, Canvas courses are published 5-7 days before class begins.

## Career Coaching Assignments

1. Familiarize yourself with the [Career Coaching program](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching), and review the [Code 301 Career Coaching Syllabus](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/Code_301/301_Career_Coaching_Syllabus). 
1. Reflect on how to boost your [Professional Etiquette](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/Code_301/Professional_Etiquette)
1. Build up your bank of [Behavioral Questions](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/Code_301/Behavioral_Questions)
1. Practice your [Professional Pitch](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/Code_301/Professional_Pitch_Draft)

## Code Assignments

### jQuery

Complete the introductory [SoloLearn jQuery Course](https://www.sololearn.com/Play/jQuery). The Canvas submission is a screenshot indicating that the course is complete.

### Chocolate Pizza CSS

**If you are coming from a Code 201 class that ended within 2 weeks of the start of your Code 301 class**, this assignment is optional. 

Students in Code 201 complete a time-boxed design comp assignment, called "Chocolate Pizza". This is a revisiting of that assignment:

  - Rather than the "complete as much of the assignment as you can in the available time" approach in Code 201, the goal here is to get the HTML/CSS mockup to be pixel-perfect.
  - Create and use a 960-pixel CSS grid system to manage display of the content. Look at [this article](http://j4n.co/blog/Creating-your-own-css-grid-system) as a reference.
  - Your column of content should be centered in the window, as in the preview image.
  - Your solution does not need to be responsive in any way.
  - Do not use any negative margins, or flex positioning.

**Instructions:**

1. Create and clone a new GitHub repository to house the code for this project.
2. Immediately check out a new branch in which to do your work.
3. Save the contents of the [`assets` directory](https://github.com/codefellows/code-301-prework/tree/master/assets){:target="_blank"} into an `assets` directory in your project.
3. Write your code in two files: `index.html` and `style.css`. You do not need to include JavaScript.
3. Use the included `PREVIEW.png` image as a reference; your goal is to match it as closely as possible.
4. Making regular Git commits with appropriately descriptive commit messages while you are working.
5. When finished, be sure to push your final code to GitHub and merge your branch into `master`.
6. Deploy your page on GitHub Pages via the options in the repository "Settings" tab.
7. Submit the links to your repository AND your deployment in the corresponding Canvas assignment.


### Setup of Your Laptop Dev Environment (Canvas assignment)

This next section will walk you through setting up your local environment. There is also a related Canavs assignment that you need to turn in for this. 

When you are done installing both the Heroku CLI and postgres, make sure to verify them again one directly after the other so that both of the output message are on your terminal screen at the same time. Once they are both on your screen, take a screen single screen shot and use that as your submission for your canvas assignment.
